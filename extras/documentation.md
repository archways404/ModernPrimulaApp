ModernPrimula is currently in Beta.

If you wish to test the current version of the program or help with the beta testing, then this document will contain most or if not all the instuctions needed in order to run the program.

I plan on releasing the compiled version "ModernPrimula.exe" soon, but for now this is the only way to run the application.

### Requirements

- NodeJS must be installed

### Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/archways404/modernprimulaapp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or Clone the [Repository](https://github.com/archways404/modernprimulaapp)

2. If you downloaded the files, unzip them and place them on ex the Desktop

3. Open up your terminal ("CMD" on windows, "Terminal" on MacOS & Linux)

4. Now use the command "cd" to navigate to the destination where you have saved or cloned the files

ex:

Navigate to desktop:

```bash
cd Desktop
```

List all the files:

```bash
ls
```

Navigate to the downloaded folder:

```bash
cd main
```

Navigate to the source folder:

```bash
cd source
```

5. Install the node modules

```bash
npm install
```

6. Run the program

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running!

***NOTE that the program won't actually submit the salary. I will update the repo with instructions on how to turn on submission!***
