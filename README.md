## BETA TESTING

I will try and publish a compiled version, but if you wish to try anyways:

 - make sure that you have nodeJS installed
 - Download the files or clone the repository

Clone or download the repository

Open the repository in any terminal / commandline, ex:

```bash
cd downloads/ModernPrimulaApp
```

Once you are in the folder run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

After you are done with the installation, you can run the program by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running!

***NOTE that the program won't actually submit the salary. I will update the repo with instructions on how to turn on submission!***
